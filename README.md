# pta-app

## Getting Started
### `npm run dev`
Runs both the server and react app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Directories and files
- Evertything outside of the `client` folder is used by the express server.
  - `server.ts` is the entry script for the server. It contains most of the server logic.
- Everything within the `client` folder is related to the react client.
